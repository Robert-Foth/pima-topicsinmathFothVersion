        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>At some time in your mathematical course work background you may have been introduced to different problem solving strategies. This chapter is going to have you go back and revisit some of those ideas and maybe introduce new ones. You may or may not have been at an age where you could appreciate what was being taught about those lesson, but hopefully now you will be at that level to see what the goal is and how these can be applied in your life in general (not just in this math course).</p>
    <p>In this section we are just giving the tools to help with processes of solving problems, but in each of the following chapters you will have the opportunity to apply what you have learned in different applications. We end the textbook by revisiting this topic for more open ended type questions and see how we can apply what we have learned to various problems. </p>

        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>Below are the learning objectives for each section of the chapter.    </p>
    <p>Make sure to read each section carefully and take notes. You should also stop to work on the TryItNow problems when you reach them before moving on.</p>
